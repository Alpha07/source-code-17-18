## pset3-4 - questions.md

### NAME: <Your name here>
Instructions for pset3-4 are as follows:
 - Answer the 25 questions below in this file called `questions.md`. Use class notes, reference sheets, and *D is for Digital* (among other resources) to help you answer them.
 - Work on *one* of the following three programs:
    - [Fifteen](https://docs.cs50.net/2017/ap/problems/fifteen/fifteen.html)
        - slug: `cs50/2017/ap/fifteen` 
    - [Scramble](https://docs.cs50.net/2017/ap/problems/scramble/1/scramble1.html)
        - slug: `cs50/2017/ap/scramble/1` 
    - [Sudoku](https://docs.cs50.net/2017/ap/problems/sudoku/sudoku.html)
        - slug: `cs50/2017/ap/sudoku`
        - **NOTE: There is no `check50` for `sudoku.c`, only `submit50`. Also, you need only implement the four elements under "Required Features"; what falls under "The student becomes the teacher" is optional.**
    - Rubric for pset3-4: [Master Grading Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CJ2SKlVl-AeDdn3kue-mvUBJgfYAZ9XJBZLSaVLRkqI/view#gid=2000629522)
        - We will discuss in class what is meant by "sufficient commenting" 

To get this file into your workspace, run `cd source-code-17-18` followed by `git pull`. Then, run the command `mkdir ~/workspace/pset3-4` followed by `cp chapters3-4/questions.md ~/workspace/pset3-4`. When the time comes to submit, simply right-click on the file in the file browser to your left and select "Download." Once this download finishes, you can upload it to PowerSchool.

The due date for pset3-4 is **8 p.m. on Wednesday, December 13**. By that time you most both upload your `questions.md` to the PowerSchool dropbox and use `submit50` to submit your programming work.

One final note: You may see questions in your program specifications that you are expected to answer in a `questions.txt` file to be submitted with your program code. Ignore them. Any questions I want you to answer have already been incorporated here.

### Searching
 - Why is it that both linear search and binary search are Ω(1) algorithms? *Write your answer here. Repeat for each question, making sure that there is an asterisk at the beginning and end of each of your answers.*
 - What is the one precondition that is required for binary search to work?
 - In what situations is it better to use binary search than linear search? Why?

### Sorting
 - In the context of comparing algorithms, what do these symbols mean: O (Big-O), Ω (Big-Omega), and θ (Big-Theta)?
 - What does it mean for bubble sort to be an O(n^2) algorithm?
 - What does it mean for selection sort to be a θ(n^2) algorithm?
 - What does it mean for insertion sort to be an Ω(n) algorithm?
 - How does merge sort perform in both best-case and worst-case scenarios?

### Computational Complexity
 - What does "P v. NP" mean in terms of solving and checking solutions to computational problems?
 - What is does "P" stand for in the context of "P v. NP"?
 - What is does "NP" stand for in the context of "P v. NP"?
 - In your own words, what is the Traveling Salesman Problem?
 - In your own words, what is the 0/1 Knapsack Problem?
 - What is a heuristic?
 - In your own words, what is the Halting Problem? Who wrote the proof for it?
 - Are there questions that computers can never answer? (Answer with one word.)

### Hexadecimal
 - What is the highest value you can represent with 1 hexadecimal digit?
 - How many hexadecimal digits are needed to represent 1 byte of data?
 - What is hexadecimal value `0x2B` in binary?
 - What is binary value `01101101` in hexadecimal?

### Images
 - How many different colors does the BMP format support? GIF? JPEG? PNG?
 - Which of the formats supports animation?
 - What's the difference between lossy and lossless compression?
 - Which of these formats is lossy-compressed?
 - What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? (Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers.)"
