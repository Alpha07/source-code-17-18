## Problem
Declare 7 int variables, and set them to the values: 82, 111, 115, 101, 98, 117 and 100. Print them in sequence (no spaces!) first with <strong>int placeholders (i.e. conversion specifiers)</strong>. Then, print a blank line and print them with <strong>char placeholders</strong>. What is the secret message? How and why does this work?
